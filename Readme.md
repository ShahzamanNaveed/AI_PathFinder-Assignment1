# AI Pathfinder – Uninformed Search Visualizer

A Python-based GUI application that visualizes classical Uninformed Search Algorithms on a 10×10 grid environment.
This project demonstrates how different search strategies explore a state space and find paths from a Start node to a Target node, including animated step-by-step visualization.

# 📌 Implemented Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented and fully visualized:
🔵 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

🟢 Depth-First Search (DFS)

🟡 Depth-Limited Search (DLS)

🟣 Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)

🔴 Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

🟠 Bidirectional Search

# 🎯 Project Features

✔️ 10×10 Grid Environment
✔️ Static walls / obstacles
✔️ Diagonal movement support
✔️ Weighted diagonal cost (√2) for UCS
✔️ Animated step-by-step visualization
✔️ Frontier and explored node highlighting
✔️ Bidirectional search with meeting node visualization
✔️ User-defined depth limit for DLS
✔️ GUI-based algorithm selection
✔️ Legend for color explanation

# 🖼️ Visualization Details
Each algorithm visually displays:
🟩 Start Node (S)

🟥 Target Node (T)

⬛ Walls

🔵 Explored Nodes

🔷 Frontier Nodes

🟣 Final Path

🟠 Meeting Node (Bidirectional only)

Bidirectional search uses separate colors for:

Forward exploration

Backward exploration

# 🚀 How to Run
